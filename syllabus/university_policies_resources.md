## Academic Dishonesty

This course will adhere to The University of Scranton Academic Code of Honesty, available at https://www.scranton.edu/academics/cte/acad-integ/acad-code-honesty.shtml. Violations of the policy may result in a lower grade for a particular assignment, reporting to the Dean, and possible course failure. Selected examples of academic dishonesty are given below.

1. **Cheating:** Students shall not give, receive, offer, or solicit information on examinations, quizzes, etc. This includes but is not limited to the following classes of dishonesty:
   - Copying from another student's paper.
   - Use during the examination of prepared materials, notes, or texts other than those specifically permitted by the instructor.
   - Collaboration with another student during the examination.
   - Buying, selling, stealing, soliciting, or transmitting an examination or any material purported to be the unreleased contents of coming examinations or the use of any such material.
   - Substituting for another person during an examination or allowing such substitutions for oneself.

2. **Collusion:** Collusion is defined as obtaining from another party, without specific approval in advance by the instructor, assistance in the production of work offered for credit to the extent that the work reflects the ideas of the party consulted rather than those of the person whose name is on the work submitted.

3. **Duplicity:** Duplicity is defined as offering for credit identical or substantially unchanged work in two or more courses, without specific advanced approval of the instructors involved.

4. **Plagiarism:** Plagiarism is defined as adopting and reproducing as one's own, to appropriate to one's use, and to incorporate in one's own work without acknowledgement the ideas or passages from the writings or works of others.

The CARE Team is a group of academic, Student Life, and Mission & Ministry staff members who meet bi-weekly during the semester to discuss and offer informed, coordinated responses to support students who may be experiencing academic, behavioral, emotional, wellness, and/or social concerns. Students are referred to the CARE team often from faculty and staff who are concerned about them based on behaviors they have observed.

## Title IX — Required Reporter Obligations

As a faculty member, I am deeply invested in the well-being of each student I teach. I am here to assist you with your work in this course. Additionally, if you come to me with other non-course-related concerns, I will do my best to help.

It is important for you to know that all faculty members are required to report incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct involving students. This means that I cannot keep information about sexual harassment or discrimination, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence or stalking confidential if you share that information with me. I will keep the information as private as I can but am required to bring it to the attention of the University's Title IX Coordinator, Elizabeth M. Garcia, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Diana M. Collins, who, in conversation with you, will explain available support, resources, and options. I will not report anything to anybody without first letting you know and discussing choices as to how to proceed.

The University's Counseling Center (570-941-7620) is available to you as a confidential resource; counselors (in the counseling center) do not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator.

Members of the University community, applicants for employment or admissions, guests, and visitors have the right to be free from harassment or discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sex, pregnancy and related conditions, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, genetic information, national origin, ethnicity, family responsibilities, marital status, veteran or military status, citizenship status, or any other status protected by applicable law.

Students who believe they have been subject to harassment or discrimination based on any of the above class of characteristics, or experience sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or gender discrimination should contact Elizabeth M. Garcia, Title IX Coordinator, (570) 941-6645, elizabeth.garcia2@scranton.edu, or Deputy Title IX Coordinator Diana M. Collins (570) 941-6645, diana.collins@scranton.edu.
